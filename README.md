# PrimaryCalculus â€” Software for Second Study

This software is writen as part of my research on how to teach calculus in
primary education, which I call primary calculus (see also
http://primarycalculus.org ). The software is a microworld for students to
study and explore the context of filling glasses with water. They can add
different glasses to the microworld and fill them, coordinating volume,
height, and time, allowing them to start exploring the rate of change of the water
level in the glass. By automatically drawing a graph or bar chart, they can
explore rate of change mathematically without having to know and master
difficult mathematical concepts like algebra, function, and limit.

This software is a prototype that I used to perform a small scale
instructional experiment (see http://primarycalculus.org/tue-experiment/ ) to
find out how fifth grade students (11 years old) develop their reasoning about
rate of change in the context of filling glasses. In the primary school
curriculum, rate of change is introduced in the context of motion and treated
as a ratio of distance and time only (at least this is the case in my locale).
However, by using computerized thinking tools like this software, I believe
primary school students are able to mathematize more complex topics like rate
of change.

## Acknowledgements

I built this software on top of bootstrap, jquery, raphael.js, and d3.js.
Furthermore, I used browserify, coffeescript, ruby, and vim.
